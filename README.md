# SOLID - the five principles of object-oriented programming

- **S - Single Responsibility Principle** - A class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job (only one responsibility). 
- **O - Open/Closed Principle** - Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. The class should be easily extendable without modifying the class itself. Inheritance is one way to achieve it.
